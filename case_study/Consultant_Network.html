               <h1>Overview</h1>
               <p>The consultant network vision is to brand every individual consultant or company to provide service under their roof. An opportunity given to serve the customers across geographic locations. So they want to provide the admins the tools to monitor, analyse and assess feedbacks of their customers at regular intervals after service of their registered consultants. The report would compare the individual’s stats to a calculated benchmark to help compare themselves to their peers. Seek more information about how they can fully convert the new applicants via their existing application portal into an authorised consultant.</p>

               <p>&nbsp</p>
               <h1>Problem</h1>
               <p>Individual Consultants or group of companies enrolment as a consultant had a rise in recent years. For those who wants to brand them as a consultant need to take up a paid certification and membership. Large amount of enrollment is a phenomenal branding, whereas great investment for a consultant or company. It can be overwhelming for an admin to not know the curated list and details of applied or enrolled consultant.The application data has to bridge with the user action, repeating the same search criteria everytime they login, without a choice of customization or save option.</p>
               <p>&nbsp; </p>
               <h1>My Role</h1>
               <p>My role within the team as a UX Designer/ Interaction Designer was to implement the UX strategy, lead the project, ensuring we deliver user-centered product, experience design enhanced version than the existing.  As the work we do we never do alone without collaborations with a business analyst, product manager, product owner and a large team of both front-end developers and application software engineers, attributing their inputs in a rich way.
               </p>
               <p>I successfully embedded UX process into a fast paced agile environment where was able to quickly iterate design ideas and assumptions in initial stage based on user validation along with feedback assessment.</p>

               <h1>Challenge</h1>
               <p>Features and functionality had to be prioritised, evolve from a simple - fair foundation into an extreme comprehensive application, serving variant users.  A very short deadline to pitch identified solution to the client, since we had a competitor in queue working on this parallel. 
               </p>
               <p> 
                  To "WIN" this project was the trigger that kept us going...

               <p>Heuristic Analysis conducted on predominant screens to form a coherent UX strategy, empathy the users and their objectives to be achieved while using the application.</p>
               <p>Sequenced an omni-Channel journey for the admin to access information at one place without a need to switch between tabs, crossing multiple channels as they progress through their tasks or seek alternate means of engaging with the application</p>

               <p>Over 1 million admin users, with 35 million active consultants across widely spread locations. We had very limited access to the users in different regions US, EMEA, APAC. 
               </p>
               <p>Was given a choice to grasp user needs, but with no access to them directly. So captured user preferences expressed through interest graphs and analytics so could drive design with contextual data.</p>

               <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
               <p>I worked very much the end-to-end process. End-to-end being user research, analysis and conversion of that data to a well defined task flow in the form of information architecture. IA being thorough with many iterative feedbacks from team and stakeholders.</p>

                  Wireframes had to eradicate both functional and interaction deficiencies in the entire portal that needed improvement at regular intervals before the application design could be launched across global platforms.
               </p>
               <p>Paper Prototypes were made with sequential user flow that uncovered the in-effective norms, while later on created the interactive prototypes for stakeholder’s demo.</p>

               <h1>Success Stories</h1>
               <p>The initial sketches of application portal can be traced back, when I had an idea for a one-roof hub space that allowed users to sequence their data to be consumed to take actions. Instead of searching through the entire portal one by one. That idea realized itself in a great way called admin dashboard, which took off.
</p>
               <p>It was finally approved, YES! We won it and bagged the project to work upon to deliver as final product. New interface was up in the portal, received glowing praise for it’s intuitive design and how feasible it was to get entire data in the dashboard.</p>
               <img class="p-img-1" src="../images/ACN/paper.jpg" alt="Taykit" />
               <p>&nbsp</p>
               <h1>Learning</h1>
               <p> Research and analysis proved that current application portal are heavy content with multiple clicks, with no user dynamics and limited customization options. I learnt to classify the basic skeleton of interface in terms of hierarchy, prioritzed the interaction and therefore came up with user focused product as an output.</p>
