          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            We often run a Google search on the top industrial honchos to learn
            from their words of wisdom to understand nuances of user experience
            and hidden facts of usability. However, being inhabitants of world
            for more than billions of years we seem to have lost touch with our
            own intellectual cultural heritage. Our handpicked choice was to
            research “Chettinad houses" and “Chettiyars" community, at Karaikudi
            –heritage town of Tamilnadu. According to Chettiyars (Inhabitants of
            Karaikudi)), their well-versed architecture and skillset define the
            way they solved some of identified problems enhancing cohesive
            experience for generations, which we just need to inculcate as such
            based on the needs of modern times. It throws light on the fact that
            every human behavior is pertaining to a cultural heritage value
            embedded in his/her society (identified groups/ community) he/she
            belongs to. So why not go back to roots and learn from
            archaeological sites that are truly eternal? This thought initiated
            the need to start this socio-cultural study.

            A study about palatial houses that still stand strong –a evidence to
            Chettiyar’s unique style of architecture, as they built and
            implemented strategies for a better livelihood experience.

            Apart from being inspired, my role was to cover some great
            anecdotes, unpredictable cultural insights and shed some light on
            the most fascinating architecture along the way.

            Our great epics if referred back to, have classified human inherent
            tendency that stand true to the modern times. I am sure many of us
            must have found it hard to explore or understand some great
            treasures hidden in ancient scripture, sculptures and artifacts.

          <p>
            Our goal in speaking with “Chettiyars" and embarking on this project
            was not to publish a architecture study, but rather to collect
            stories and share how this generation still benefits through the
            conceptual architecture of their ancestors.

          <h1>Exploring architecture through the Lens of UX</h1>
          <p>
            To start with, every house has a story and every story spins for
            generations together all around one single house. In those times,
            their ancestors constructed house periodically regulating the cash
            flow through business transactions, sailing across oceans. So they
            always start with the back portion of the land and as it goes the
            house will be completed part by part. The interesting fact is that
            the methodology of architecture and house furnishing varies with the
            influence and exposure to unique findings in different parts of the
            world during their business conducts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every part of concrete limestone structure and household things
            right from closet to kitchen, backyard to bedroom emphases mainly on
            the experience and cultural values they wanted to abide in their
            livelihood strategy.

          <h1>Pride possession and characteristics of introverts</h1>
          <p>
            Every member of the family are legal heirs to the house and
            everybody possess equal share and right. For them it is the symbol
            of status and pride to safeguard their heritage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus of our qualitative research was on finding commonalities
            among Chettiyars who are strongly identified with an introverted
            mental model of lifestyle. We felt strongly about encouraging others
            to celebrate and appreciate their qualities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Introverts like them, have done well that makes them natural-born
            visionary people. Attention to detail is, what we can learn about
            their architecture talents in order to bring about those findings in
            designing better products for all of us?

          <h1>Great Visionary</h1>
          <p>
            Chettiyars tend to take time to fine-tune their house structure
            based on their need at times of segmental constructions.
            Additionally, they think ahead about possible norms that others
            might have about having better amenities in future, instead of
            winging it and risking something they might regret later.
          </p>

          />
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h1>Inheriting Legacy</h1>
          <p>
            Creativity was at its maximum in every form of the architecture.
            They had a very close knitted family who tend to stage all family
            ceremony within their house and all the rooms are in-built to hold
            as many groceries, household things inside shelves and roof racks
            for the ceremony.
          </p>
          <p>
            Daily requirements are always kept in reach while items required for
            ceremony or any family gathering are stored in a separate backyard
            rooms as well as terrace store provision with enough natural light
            and proper ventilation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amusing experience methodology, foreseen design architecture, house
            durability which constantly astounds our research. They still follow
            the customs of their ancestors and conduct wedding at home
            preserving their legacy for more than 3 generations now.

            Extended both cultural value and usability innovation in a more
            fascinating way. One such good example, provision to cook food
            itself is a extended part of the construction with placeholders for
            vessels. It has evolved from lime stone, earthenware and now cement
            slab currently being used.

          <h1>Learning</h1>
          <p>
            The most efficient way to improve experience and design is to
            observe users – social, cultural-bred people, their environment that
            has to be sensed with empathy! It teaches us lot more valuable
            learnings giving us more vicinity towards designing humanized
            products.
