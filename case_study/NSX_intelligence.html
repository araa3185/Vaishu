          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            NSX reproduces the entire network model in software, enabling any network topology—from simple to complex multi-tier networks—to be created and provisioned in seconds.
          </p>
          <p><b>NSX Intelligence - “Next Billion”</b></br>
Every business has a story to tell and these days that story usually involves data. At a time when people expect software to help make sense of their network topology and services, NSX Intelligence was set out to strive data intelligence as the name says it all auto-detect issues backed up with ML powered resolution, visualize the network in a seamlessly intelligent way. </p>
          <img class="p-img-1" src="../images/ACN/collage.jpg" alt="ACN" />
          <p>&nbsp</p>
          <h1>Requirement</h1>
          <p>NSX Intelligence - On a high level  Monitoring and Troubleshooting are the key that unfolds the broad spectrum of this feature</p>
          <p>Monitoring broadly covers four different categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Network Performance Monitoring - To be able to detect changes in network performance over a period of time and across different grouping dimensions and trigger alerts based on user defined thresholds I.e data sources, system metrics, flow data and context data 
            </li>
            <li>
              Network Connectivity - Network connectivity issues caused by configuration errors are often difficult to identify. It can be caused by several reasons, some of which are : 
              <ol>
                <li>Configuration errors</li>
                <li>Incorrect FW policies</li>
                <li>Underlying physical network issues  The goal of connectivity monitoring is to be able to detect network outages and help admin root cause the reason for outage
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Application Monitoring - Monitoring the applications such as WebApp, DB and other services running in the VM with respect to Network              </li>
            <li>Security Monitoring - Monitor and validate whether the configured policies on NSX are working as expected using the flow and data source. Analyze flows that deviate from configured FW policies through probe functionality and generate traffic to validate distributed FW rules.            </li>
          </ul>  
          <p>&nbsp</p>
          <p><b>Troubleshooting:</b></p>
          <p>NSX Intelligence works on systematic approach through user set guidelines and ML when it comes to troubleshooting. Based on specific symptoms NSXi will go through systematic elimination of potential problem and narrow down the root cause for the identified issue.</p>
            <p>&nbsp</p>
          <h1>Problem</h1>
          <p>
            People working in modern day virtualization require more than just static charts and pretty looking visualizations; they need to go beyond by drilling deeper, probing further, and understanding the forces that influence their business network & security.
          </p>
          <p>To begin with, It is very hard for customers to visualize their network setup. Most of NSX UI is based on data grids that are not conducive of clearly articulating how the network setup is related and troubleshooting was priority.          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h1>My Role</h1>
          <p>
            As a Senior designer, my role was to be the design stakeholder to ensure that data presentation is meaningful, compelling, and most importantly, easy to interpret. I laid the foundation for visualization architecture to be first of its kind in NSX through NSX Intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Defined the Interaction principles working with Customers and Product Stakeholders. Vitalized the product strategy and advocated user-centered data visualization to Engineers. Played a phenomenal role in scaling up the design team from 3 to 10 Member Team till date. Presented UX walkthrough to customers in VMworld and conducted usability sessions through focus groups involving end users. In the entire product journey design process was formalized at every step starting from research, idea conceptualization, validation through usability testing, mapping to business goals making it to be a market fit.

            NSX Intelligence (a) NSXi was a huge success and the applaudes received from audience during the launch at VMworld explains it all. One of the most fascinating journey to bring Team's effort to limelight.
          </p>

            A patent was filed for representing the data flows through visualization.

          <h1>Learning</h1>
          <p>
            Designing data visualization for a virtualization platform is not just about the visuals, but why those visuals matter in the data analysis process, and how they can ensure intuitive business operations dynamically for end user. As technology keeps advancing with new requirements learning be like never-ending.
